# pvectl

**A command-line utility for Proxmox VE.** Manage a container
or VM - start, stop, snapshot, back up, edit, or migrate it — all
without leaving your terminal or memorizing a container or vm id.

![pvectl demo](pvectl-demo.gif)

## Why pvectl

- **Unified management.** No need to remember what node your hosts are on. Run it on your laptop.
- **Tab completion.** Suggests VM and container names as you type.
- **Status polling.** Anything that runs as a background
  Proxmox task  shows a live  spinner and a final `✓`/`✗` summary with timing.
- **Secrets stay in your keychain.** `pvectl setup` stores your API token
  secret in the OS keychain, if available.
- **Use with your coding agent.** Works with your harness of choice.
  `-o json`/`--output json` gets machine-readable output on list/summary
  commands instead of a table, and `pvectl schema` prints the full command
  tree (names, flags, descriptions) as JSON for introspection.
  `pvectl api get/post/put/delete <path>` is a raw escape hatch for any
  Proxmox API endpoint pvectl has no dedicated command for.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental, provided as-is, with no warranty.** pvectl can start,
> stop, edit, and permanently delete things on your cluster (including
> [backups](#backups) and [snapshots](#snapshots)). Review what it's about to do before confirming.
> Tested only against Proxmox VE 9+; earlier versions may behave
> differently or not work at all.

## Install

With Homebrew (macOS):

```sh
brew install davegallant/public/pvectl
```

With curl (Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davegallant/pvectl/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

With Nix:

```sh
nix profile install github:davegallant/pvectl
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/davegallant/pvectl.git
cd pvectl
go build -o pvectl ./cmd/pvectl
```

## Setup

### Create an API token

In Proxmox: **Datacenter -> Permissions -> API Tokens -> Add**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If **Privilege Separation** is left checked when creating the token, it
> starts with **zero permissions** until you grant it an ACL. `pvectl setup`
> will still succeed — but every command will silently show no containers.

Either uncheck Privilege Separation (the token then inherits the user's
full permissions), or grant an ACL explicitly:

```sh
pveum aclmod / -token 'user@realm!tokenid' -role PVEVMAdmin,PVEAuditor,PVESDNUser,PVEDatastoreUser
```

#### Node reboot permission

`pvectl nodes reboot <node>` requires the `Sys.PowerMgmt` privilege on
the node being rebooted. Proxmox's built-in roles above do not grant it,
so create a small custom role and assign it to the token:

```sh
pveum role add NodePowerMgmt -privs Sys.PowerMgmt
pveum aclmod /nodes/pve-g3-1 \
  -token 'user@realm!tokenid' \
  -role NodePowerMgmt
```

Replace `pve-g3-1` with the node name. Custom role IDs cannot begin with
the case-insensitive reserved `PVE` prefix, which is why the example uses
`NodePowerMgmt` rather than `PVEPowerMgmt`.

To permit rebooting every node, add `NodePowerMgmt` to the token's existing
comma-separated `-role` list on `/`; keep the existing roles in that list so
the ACL update does not replace them. With Privilege Separation enabled,
the token's owning user must also have `Sys.PowerMgmt`, since a token's
permissions cannot exceed its owner's permissions.

Node reboot always asks for a literal `yes` confirmation unless `-y` or
`--yes` is supplied:

```sh
pvectl nodes reboot pve-g3-1
```

### Run setup

```sh
pvectl setup
```

This prompts for your Proxmox host, token ID, and
token secret; validates them against the cluster; and stores them.
Add `--insecure-skip-verify` if your cluster uses a self-signed certificate.

Once setup is complete, you can run `pvectl status` to verify your cluster is healthy:

## Usage

For full usage instructions, see [`the cli docs`](docs/cli/pvectl.md).

See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for proposed improvements and development priorities.

### Examples

List containers across the cluster:

```console
$ pvectl ct ls
VMID  NAME                         NODE      STATUS
100   radarr                       pve-g3-1  running
101   umami                        pve-g3-2  running
103   speedtest-tracker            pve-g3-1  running
104   immich                       pve-g3-1  running
108   jellyfin                     pve-g3-1  running
117   gyb                          pve-g3-1  stopped
```

Get a quick health summary for one container, by name or vmid:

```console
$ pvectl ct summary jellyfin
Container 108 (jellyfin) on node "pve-g3-1"

Status        running
HA State      none
Node          pve-g3-1
Unprivileged  yes

CPU usage      0.00% of 4 CPUs
Memory usage   16.32% (668.3M of 4G)
SWAP usage     N/A
Bootdisk size  33.67% (21G of 62.4G)

IPs:
  eth0: 192.168.1.27
  docker0: 172.17.0.1
  br-ce76d6037564: 172.18.0.1
  tailscale0: 100.126.69.73
```

Grow a container's root disk on the fly:

```console
$ pvectl ct resize changedetection --size "+1G"
✓ resized changedetection (138) disk rootfs to +1G (1s)
```

Check storage usage across every node in the cluster:

```console
$ pvectl storage ls
NAME                USED    TOTAL   USE  HEALTH
local@pve-g3-1      46.8G   67.7G   69%  OK
local@pve-g3-2      53.3G   93.9G   57%  OK
local-lvm@pve-g3-1  106.9G  141.2G  76%  OK
local-lvm@pve-g3-2  184.4G  794.3G  23%  OK
moredata            221.4G  912.8G  24%  OK
proxmox-backups     762.1G  4.8T    15%  OK
proxmox-iso         762.1G  4.8T    15%  OK
```

Other frequently used commands: `pvectl ct start/stop/restart <name>`,
`pvectl qm ls`, `pvectl status`, and `pvectl tasks ls --watch` for a
live-refreshing view of cluster activity.

If a task wait is interrupted or loses contact with Proxmox, pvectl prints
its UPID. The task may still be running on the cluster. Check it later with
`pvectl tasks status <upid>`, read its complete log with `pvectl tasks logs
<upid>`, or resume waiting with `pvectl tasks wait <upid>`. Add
`--wait-timeout 5m` to bound a wait without cancelling the server task.

### Backups

Backups can be created, deleted, listed, and restored with `pvectl ct backups` and `pvectl qm backups`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Proxmox has no trash/undo for a deleted backup — this is permanent.

### Migrations

Containers and VMs can be migrated to another node in the cluster with `pvectl ct migrate` and `pvectl qm migrate`.

> [!NOTE]
> A running container is restarted on the target node (true live migration
> of a running container isn't reliably available); a running VM is live
> migrated with no downtime.

By default the guest's volumes land on the storage with the same ID on the
target node. When the nodes don't share storage IDs, name the target
node's storage with `--target-storage` (equivalent to `pct migrate
--target-storage` / `qm migrate --targetstorage`):

```sh
pvectl ct migrate 101 --target pve-apollo --target-storage local-lvm
```

A `source:target,...` mapping works too, to send different source storages
to different places (e.g. `--target-storage local-lvm:fast,backup:bulk`).

### Snapshots

Snapshots can be created, listed, deleted, and rolled back with `pvectl ct snapshots` and `pvectl qm snapshots`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Rolling back discards every change made since the snapshot was taken —
> this cannot be undone.

### Renaming

Containers and VMs can be renamed with `pvectl ct rename` and `pvectl qm rename`.

### Creating containers and VMs

New LXC containers can be created with `pvectl ct create`; new QEMU VMs
with `pvectl qm create`. Unlike `ct create`'s required OS template,
`qm create`'s `--iso` is optional — the prompt (or `--iso` flag) accepts an
empty reply to skip it and create a disk-only VM (e.g. for a later disk
import).

Both accept `--tags` (comma-separated) to tag the new guest. `qm create`
also takes cloud-init settings — `--ciuser`, `--cipassword`, `--sshkeys
<file>`, and `--ipconfig0` — which provision a cloud-init drive:

```sh
pvectl qm create --name web01 --ciuser debian \
  --sshkeys ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --ipconfig0 ip=dhcp
```

Pass `--cipassword -` to be prompted for the password instead of putting
it in your shell history.

For scripts, pass `--non-interactive`. Container creation then requires
`--node`, `--template`, `--storage`, and `--hostname`; VM creation requires
`--node`, `--storage`, and `--name`. Missing flags are reported together
before creation. Omitting `--iso` creates a disk-only VM, and omitting
`--start` leaves either guest stopped; `--vmid` may still be omitted to
auto-assign an ID.

Structured config fields can also be changed without an editor:

```sh
pvectl ct config set web01 description 'web server'
pvectl qm config unset oldvm description
```

`set` and `unset` fetch the current config and send its digest to protect
against concurrent changes. They do not handle raw `lxc.*` lines or
volume-backed fields (disks, mounts), API control parameters, or QEMU
`sshkeys` (which needs special encoding); use the dedicated commands or
Proxmox UI for those. `unset` uses Proxmox's field-removal API, unlike
deleting a line in `config edit`, which remains unsupported.

> [!NOTE]
> Cloud-init cannot be combined with `--iso` — both occupy `ide2`, and a
> cloud-init VM boots an imported cloud image rather than installing from
> an ISO.

### Templates and ISOs

LXC OS templates can be fetched from Proxmox's appliance catalog, and ISOs
from any URL the cluster can reach:

```console
$ pvectl templates ls
TEMPLATE                                    OS         VERSION   DESCRIPTION
alpine-3.23-default_20260116_amd64.tar.xz   alpine     20260116  LXC default image for alpine 3.23
debian-13-standard_13.0-1_amd64.tar.zst     debian-13  13.0-1    Debian 13 Trixie (standard)

$ pvectl templates download debian-13-standard_13.0-1_amd64.tar.zst --storage local
✓ downloaded debian-13-standard_13.0-1_amd64.tar.zst to local (24s)

$ pvectl iso download https://example.com/debian-13.iso --storage proxmox-iso
```

`pvectl templates ls --downloaded` and `pvectl iso ls` show what's already
on storage. The node does the fetching, not pvectl, so the URL has to be
reachable from the cluster and the transfer runs as a background task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Downloading needs the `Datastore.AllocateTemplate` privilege, which the
> `PVEDatastoreUser` role in the [setup ACL](#create-an-api-token) does
> *not* grant — a token without it fails with `Permission check failed
> (/storage/<id>, Datastore.AllocateTemplate)`. Listing is unaffected.
> Grant `PVEDatastoreAdmin`:
>
> ```sh
> pveum aclmod /storage -token 'user@realm!tokenid' -role PVEDatastoreAdmin
> ```
>
> If one storage still fails after that, check for a narrower ACL entry on
> it. Proxmox resolves permissions most-specific-path-first, so a role
> assigned directly on `/storage/<id>` **replaces** — rather than adds
> to — anything inherited from `/`. A leftover `PVEDatastoreUser` on
> `/storage/local` will keep shadowing a `PVEDatastoreAdmin` granted at
> `/`. Check the effective privileges for a path with:
>
> ```sh
> pvectl api get /access/permissions --data path=/storage/local
> ```

### Console access

`pvectl ct enter` and `pvectl qm enter` reach a guest's console one of two ways:

- **`ssh` (default)** — shells out to `ssh <node> pct enter <vmid>` / `ssh
  <node> qm terminal <vmid>`, so it relies on your own SSH config/agent
  rather than credentials stored by `pvectl`.
- **`api`** — opens the proxmox console websocket (the same one the web
  UI's "Console" button uses) directly over your stored API token, no SSH
  access to the node required. Enable it by answering yes to the
  console-access prompt in `pvectl setup`, or use it for a single run with
  `--method api` (or force `--method ssh` even if `api` is your configured
  default).

If using `ssh`, set up your [SSH config](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ssh_config.5.html) in this format:

```
Host <node1-name>
  HostName <node1-host-or-ip>
  User <user>
  IdentityFile <path/to/key>
Host <node2-name>
  HostName <node2-host-or-ip>
  User <user>
  IdentityFile <path/to/key>
```

A VM console (either method) requires a serial console device — without
one you'll see `unable to find a serial interface`. To add one:

```sh
qm set <vmid> --serial0 socket
```

Then reboot the VM and make sure the guest OS redirects its console to it
(Linux: `console=ttyS0` on the kernel command line — most cloud images
already set this; Windows needs EMS/COM port configuration instead).

> [!NOTE]
> **LXC login prompt on `api`:** SSH's `pct enter` gives a trusted root
> shell with no login. The `api` method instead attaches to the
> container's actual console tty — like a physical console — which may
> show a login prompt. Many templates ship with root's password locked;
> set one first if you plan to rely on `api` for containers
> (`pct exec <vmid> -- passwd root`).
>
> **Detaching:** type `~.` at the start of a line to
> disconnect without ending the remote session 

For one-off non-interactive commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, ...),
use `pvectl ct exec <name-or-vmid> -- <command...>`. Tab completion for the
command's own arguments SSHes into the container and lists matching remote
paths (e.g. `pvectl ct exec <name-or-vmid> -- cat docker-comp<TAB>`).

VMs have `pvectl qm exec <name-or-vmid> -- <command...>`, which runs
through the QEMU guest agent instead of SSH:

```console
$ pvectl qm exec homeassistant -- uname -r
6.18.37-haos
```

> [!NOTE]
> `qm exec` is not `ct exec`'s equal, and can't be. Proxmox's guest-agent
> API is fire-and-poll: there's no stdin, no tty, and no output until the
> command exits, so interactive or long-running commands aren't a fit
> (`--timeout`, default 30s, bounds the wait). The command is passed as
> argv with no shell involved, so shell syntax needs an explicit
> `sh -c '...'`. Requires the guest agent enabled on the VM
> (`qm set <vmid> --agent 1`) and running inside the guest.

### Raw config passthrough

Raw `lxc.*` config lines (cgroup device rules, bind mounts, and anything
else with no dedicated Proxmox API parameter) can be appended to a
container's config with `pvectl ct config append --line "..."` (repeatable):

```sh
pvectl ct config append <name-or-vmid> \
  --line "lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm" \
  --line "lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net dev/net none bind,create=dir"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Proxmox's REST API doesn't expose raw `lxc.*` directives at all, so this
> falls back to `ssh <node> cat >> /etc/pve/lxc/<vmid>.conf`.

### Validation coverage

Release CI runs vet, lint, unit tests, generated-doc checks, and launches
GoReleaser-built amd64 archives on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Arm64
archives are cross-built but not executed. CI does not connect to a live
Proxmox cluster or exercise SSH/API consoles or real OS keychains; the
keychain tests use an in-memory fake. Those combinations need manual
integration testing against a disposable cluster before relying on them.
