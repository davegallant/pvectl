## pvectl qm exec

Run a command inside a VM via the QEMU guest agent, non-interactively

### Synopsis

Run a command inside a VM via the QEMU guest agent, non-interactively.

Unlike "pvectl ct exec", this does not stream. Proxmox's guest-agent API
is fire-and-poll: the command is started, then polled for completion, and
its output is only readable once it has exited. There is no stdin, no tty,
and no incremental output — so interactive or long-running commands are
the wrong fit, and that is a property of the Proxmox API rather than
something pvectl can work around.

The command is passed to the guest as argv, with no shell involved. Shell
syntax needs an explicit shell:

  pvectl qm exec myvm -- sh -c 'ls /etc | head'

Requires the guest agent to be enabled on the VM (qm set <vmid> --agent 1)
and running inside the guest.

```
pvectl qm exec <name-or-vmid> -- <command> [args...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help               help for exec
      --timeout duration   how long to wait for the command to finish (default 30s)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --debug                   log Proxmox API request/response activity to stderr
  -o, --output string           output format: "table" or "json" (supported read commands and raw API) (default "table")
      --verbose                 show Proxmox task IDs (UPIDs) alongside action output
      --wait-timeout duration   maximum time to wait for a Proxmox task (0 waits indefinitely)
```
